    <h2>Poetry</h2>
    <h4>BOY CRUSH</h4>
    <p>	His smile was the black plague. You’d look up from your journal, and there he was, his head tilted slightly upward, drifting off into fairy dreamland. You wished you could go there with him someday. And then the smile came; he had the cutest dimples you’d ever seen. It was impossible not to smile back. That smile fills your heart with a thousand butterflies. He always seemed so happy, even when he wasn’t. Even when the world dumped a steaming pile of shit right on top of him, he still smiled. He smiled, and you wanted to tell him how happy it made you. 
	His eyes carried the weight of an 18-year-old queer boy. You wonder how anyone can smile after all the struggle and pain. And then he rubs your back and tells you everything will be okay. 
	He’s always bouncing his leg or tapping a pencil. He can’t sit still, and it’s the cutest thing you’ve ever seen as he ferociously scribbles in his journal. You complement his writing, his shirt, and a joke he just told. You think about him at night and wonder if he thinks about you, too. 

	
Now you know he's thought of you, but your hope is gone. Your window is gone. Soon, he will be gone too. How far in that distant future? How long must you wait?

Can your thoughts alone make you evil?
<h4>GIRL CRUSH</h4>
<p>	She was the prettiest girl in school, and she still doesn’t know it. I’m not usually one to fall for looks.

	The prettiest flower carries the strongest poison. She is the exception. 

	Her hair was the first thing I noticed. It never looked bad, even after the most ferocious naps; she was somehow that much more attractive. Maybe it’s some primal calling to the un-perfected. 

	What really got me was the texture. Despite more bleaching and dying than she could remember, her strands were softer than your favorite blanket. They tickled my cheeks when I got close enough. 

	Knowing yourself and feeling yourself are two very different things. 

	I never felt like myself until I met her. There is a crying child living inside me. His fingers stop just before mine begin and his legs just barely reach my ankles. His heart is mine and my brain is his. He is the only one who can cry. 
	
	She is the only one who can reach him. 

	You know no other will know you the same. 

	I love to love. To be loved

is to be understood. Not for who you are on the outside, but for the crying child inside who lets himself be seen before getting out of that car and going to breakfast like nothing ever happened. Everyone knows eggs taste better with salt. 

I see the child reflected in her eyes. I hear his truth in her writing. I hope one day to taste that salt again. 
  
If all that love is is chemicals released in the brain, then lobotomize me and hook me up to your tubes and machines. I will live just as happily as I do now. Yet my soul will be searching for her until its death. And if you believe that one fucker Plato, it will never stop searching. 
</p>
<h4>WHY CREATE?</h4>
<p>CREATIVE PEOPLE DON'T WORK BY THE CLOCK.
THEY WORK BY THE IDEA. NEW IDEAS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
BETTER WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ALREADY IN HAND.
PRACTICAL WAYS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT SURELY
WILL COME.

WHEN THE PIECES COME TOGETHER,
THEY TAKE THEIR THESIS AND NAIL IT ON THE DOOR OF
CHERISHED BELIEFS.
OFTEN THOSE SECURE INSIDE ARE LESS THAN OVERJOYED.

NEW IDEAS CREATE PROBLEMS,
CHALLENGE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS,
UPSET CAREFULLY WORKED TIMETABLES,
FORCE PEOPLE TO CHANGE DIRECTION WHEN THEY'VE
ONLY JUST FINISHED SETTING A COURSE.

SOMETIMES, IT'S EASIER TO STICK TO THE TIMETABLE,
TO TELL THE CREATIVE PERSON THAT THEIR IDEA ISN'T
WANTED JUST YET. TO TELL HIM OR HER TO STOP
THINKING. BUT CREATIVE PEOPLE CAN'T HELP THINKING.

SO THEY LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL AND AN
IDEA ARE MORE IMPORTANT.

    <h2>Fiction</h2>
    <h4>I wrote this story to sleep at night</H4>
      <p>
        Nicole hated staying at her dad’s. The house was more of a trailer, and every day, someone she had never met was sleeping on the couch or curled up in the hallway. When Nicole woke one night with a full bladder, she had to step over three guys passed out on the floor just to reach the bathroom. Her dad thought buying a mattress wasn’t worth it, so she slept on the floor of her room with a pile of blankets. “They try to scam you, these mattress stores,” her dad shouted from the couch one afternoon, where he sat playing Call of Duty. “How do you think they stay in business? Who’s actually buying enough mattresses to pay the rent or keep the lights on, let alone make a profit?” Nicole had grown accustomed to her father's skepticism. She knew if she stayed quiet, he would tire himself out.
“The same bed. You’ll walk in one day, and two years later you’ll go back and they’ll still be selling the same bed.”
Nicole gathered five or six empty beer cans from the kitchen floor.
“It’s ridiculous! These beds, the ones they sell for thousands of dollars, only have a half-life of about six months. You know?” 
She crushed the cans one by one beneath her foot.
“By the time you buy a mattress that’s been sitting there for a year or two, it's only worth about a quarter of the sticker price. Not to mention, your sleep will be all messed up.” 
With the precision of a veteran sharpshooter, Nicole flung the cans at her father's head. 
During the school week, Nicole stayed at her mom's. To Nicole, her mom’s house was a safe haven. She would make lunch in the kitchen, half-naked, or blast The Cranberries in surround sound without the fear of being judged. Upon arriving that Monday, shock swept over Nicole’s face, hardening into dread as she discovered her cousins were staying over for the week. It was the worst five days she thought she would ever experience. For the first time in a long time, she missed her dad.
Later nicole was driving with her dad on the freeway, headed to the mall, and all she could think about was that she was finally escaping hell. For five days, she couldn't get a moment of peace. Her dad had suggested the trip last weekend, and Nicole wasn’t sure if she wanted to go. By the time Friday came, Nicole was over it. She stormed out of the house after her cousins started cutting up her journal to use as oragami; and without thinking, she picked up her phone and called her dad.

Later they were still driving and Nicole was happy to be away from her house. Her father's big idea: a day trip to the city, with shopping mall extravaganza. 
“It’s a shame what’s been happening to these malls recently,” Nicole's dad pushed  the cigarette lighter into his Navy Blue Challenger, “it used to be the spot, you know? Like the spot.”
He only ever drives this car to show off.
“Everyone would hang out there for hours, on the weekends and after school.”
Nicole picked at the fraying leather seats. 
“What do kids do nowadays? They sit on their phones and get depressed. Day after day, completely immobile.” He talked with his hands, gesturing this way and that for no one to see. “Hey, grab my Marlboros from the glove compartment, will you?”
Nicole wanted to throw them out the window. She thought momentarily, weighing the cons of the fight that would follow. Before she could act out, her dad reached over to the passenger's side and rummaged in his glove compartment until he felt the familiar shape boxy shape of his favorite vice. Holding the pack in one hand and the steering wheel in the other, he tongued out a cigarette and lit it. 
“If your mother had her way, you’d be hooked up to a screen twenty-four-seven.” He took a long drag, “In a few years, they say,” he exhaled, “you won't even be in school. You’ll get lessons downloaded straight to your brain. Soon enough, none of your thoughts will be your own.”
Nicole sat in silence, not wanting to seem too interested in what her father was saying. Secretly, though, she worried about some of the same things. Instead of talking, she observed, as her father—almost subconsciously—ashed his cigarette once, twice, three times. Then he ashed it again. 

The mall was an impressive three-story concrete monster. A huge billboard on the side of the road signaled drivers that they were almost there. Or, it used to. Since her last visit, it was replaced with an advertisement for a megachurch. If you read it vertically, the sign said “YOU MATTER DON’T GIVE UP.” If you read it horizontally, it said “YOU DONT MATTER GIVE UP.”  Nicole let out a half-laugh, half-snort. It was the first and only sound she made on the drive. 
Nicole was beaming as they entered through the living room-sized revolving door. She hadn’t been shopping in months, and her father did something she never could have expected to sweeten the deal. 
“Here, take my credit card,” he said while slinging a backpack on one shoulder. “Don’t max it out, don’t go signing a lease on a car or anything crazy. Meet in the food court in two hours.” Then, he left. A world of possibilities awaited Nicole. She had two hours, a credit card, and all the freedom in the world. Not really, but that's what she told herself. 
In Zara, Nicole bought a purse. They called it a handbag. -$40. She pocketed a pair of earrings. +$35. 
In Lululemon, she bought a skirt in a certain teal that caught her eye. -$88. She broke open a six-pack of scrunchies and took two. +$9.
The Hot Topic clerk scared Nicole. He had so many tattoos that when she first came in, she thought he was part of the wall. And he kept glancing at her through those big curved mirrors. She bought two T-shirts. Buy one, get one free -$24. 
Victoria’s Secret was Nicole's last stop before the food court. After nearly two hours of shopping and going into more than 30 stores, she was almost ready to head home. Nicole was the only one in the store, but she didn’t care. She brought four pieces into the changing room. Nothing fit. So, she put the three pieces back and left. +$45. 

Two hours. That’s what Nicole’s father had said. Two hours, one skirt, one handbag, two necklaces, a pair of earrings, three T-shirts, underwear, a sundress, a baseball cap, $1,309, and a lemonade later, Nicole was alone in the food court. She waited. The food court had this massive carousel in the middle. And a kid and his mother got on. They went around and around as the music played, and when they got off, Nicole was still waiting. She was waiting when the kid ordered a slice of pizza and got grease all over his shirt. She was waiting when the carousel worker announced, “Last ride starts in 5!” And she was waiting when the security guard walked over to her, in his all-black uniform and gun in its holster, and told her that the mall would be closing in 15 minutes. 
Big fat tears rolled down Nicole's face and landed on her shopping bags. She sat on the cold, hard floor of the parking garage, where her father had parked, now an empty lot. If there ever was a moment in Nicole's life where she needed comfort, it was this one. Just as she decided that her father was never coming back. Gone. Dead, for all she cared. Just as she picked up her bags and wiped the tears from her cheeks, Nicole heard the indistinguishable screech of 50-year-old tires. Nicole's dad whipped around the corner of the parking garage and flew straight past her. Only to slam on the brakes with another ear-wrenching squeal, and reverse until he could look his daughter in the eyes. 
Nicole wasn’t crying anymore.
“Get in, get in already.” Her father opened the passenger door for her like some kind of chauffeur. 
She stood still. Observing him as she always did. Did he have a black eye? 
“Come on, Cole, honey, hurry up,” his eye, the one that wasn’t swollen shut, pleaded with her. “I’m sorry, okay, is that what you want me to say? I didn’t mean to take so long. Will you get in the car now? Don’t you want to be getting home?”
Nicole wanted to scream. She wanted to shout: Where the hell were you? Why didn’t you call? She wanted to scream and hit him until his eyes matched. 
“I’m planning a move, okay? I just needed some extra cash for the down payment. That’s all taken care of now. I’m gonna get a house with a pool. No, a pool and a hot tub. And I’m gonna get a real job, a nice one like your mother has, you know? Then I’ll be able to see you more, you know?” With each word, his voice got slightly quieter. Weaker. Desperate. He was pleading.
Nicole screamed. Imagine a hundred Broadway singers hitting their high notes in perfect unison. It was louder than that. Channeling weeks, months, even years of anger and resentment, she threw her fist at the window of the car, and it bounced off. Her hand went limp, and her scream stopped for a split second as she sharply inhaled the musty parking garage air. Then she threw another punch. And screamed. And punched and screamed again and again until the blood-covered window smashed into a thousand tiny blood-covered shards of glass. 
Nicole calmly brushed the broken glass off her seat and joined her father in the car. “A pool and a hot tub.”

    <h4>An Exploration of Heaven</h4>
    <p>
	Bladee and Ecco2k’s song “5 Star Crest (4 Vattenrum)” explores themes of life, death, and heaven. Ecco’s nihilistic outlook combines perfectly with Bladee’s optimism to create a wonderful tribute to a friend and collaborator who passed away. “5 Star Crest (4 Vattenrum)” influences the listeners' idea of heaven within their relationships and experiences through its use of a continuously shifting beat and opposing points of view by the two singers. It helps people struggling with loss and gain to work through their emotions together, with the artists. 
	“5 Star Crest (4 Vattenrum)” is an almost nine-minute song. It is broken down into five parts each consisting of unique production and vocal sounds. There are multiple courses and outros. The song opens with a low wobbling note that stretches higher until it matches Ecoo2k’s falsetto. Ecco begins singing with the line, “Nightmares find me, they strike like lightning.” This sets the tone for Ecco’s mood throughout the song. He is struggling through a series of nightmares that strike, randomly, when he least expects. He continues his verse, shifting between a falsetto and a deeper voice. During the dreamy lines, Ecco uses the falsetto, “I look to the sky and it smiles back down on me.” When his lyrics are awake his voice is deeper, such as in the next line, “Am I missing something?” To which he responds to himself, shifting into falsetto, “A dream of life.” This dichotomy between Ecco’s dream self and true self represents his internal turmoil. He is never fully checked into reality. Instead, he uses dissociation as a coping mechanism. In the next two lines Ecco’s “dream of life” falls apart. “Close my eyes and the sun stops shining. Close my eyes and the sky falls down on me.” Once again in falsetto, he creates an image of the nightmare he described earlier. The self-destruction of his dream self leaves him repeating. “It all seems so real, am I missing something?” In repeating this question, he indirectly points it to the listener. What are you missing? 
	Without wasting a beat Bladee enters with his first verse, countering Ecco’s melancholy lyricism.
Five star the crest
Love and respect will win again
The shields shining
Golden falcons flying in
Silver glowing, three-three's open
The castle sings, D-E-O-A
D-E-O-A, quest completion
Inspiratio heroine
I’m born again, no suffering
During his verse, Bladee is creating an image of fantasy. His world of castles, golden falcons, and quests parallels Ecoo’s dream world. However, through the line “Close my eyes and the sky falls down on me,” we see that Ecco’s world collapsed in on himself, while Bladee’s imagery remains strong throughout the verse. From the start, he establishes his values, “Love and respect will win again.” This emotionally sound take on the world is out of character for him. In the second half of the verse, Bladee sings in Latin, “The castle sings, D-E-O-A. D-E-O-A, quest completion. Inspiratio heroine.” Later in the song, Bladee and Ecco make direct references to religious texts and practices. The verse ends with the line, “I’m born again no suffering,” considering the idea of reincarnation as one of many forms of heaven that both singers depict.
Bladee’s rebirth reflects his overall change in attitude on this track and the whole album, Crest. Depression and drug use would be considered by many Bladee fans as one of his most common topics to sing about. In his song “Skin” off the album Eversince he sings, “I don't want to go back to that place again (Again). Nothing will ever be the same again (Be the same again).” He is struggling with the long-term effects that his hardest times, mentally and emotionally, have on him. He is forever changed, and that is reflected throughout most of his discography, up until 2022’s Crest. This album has been a major turning point in the style and voice of Bladee as a whole. He sings more about how life will go on and to cherish the moment. A big shift from the many references to drug abuse, self-harm, and suffering in his older work. This is shown in the song “Faust” also on Crest where he sings, “Suffering stops, bodies drop. Flowers sprout, bloom, die and rot. Therefore I am, you are not. Beautiful dream, which I forgot.” The bodies dropping leads to new growth. Life and death are intertwined into one. Bladee references someone, a dream he forgot. He is moving on from his old fantasies of a perfect life. He has become content with change and death. 
Ecco2k returns to close out the first part of the song. “I am everything, fountainhead from the Arrowhead. Under iron rain, rest my head under arrowheads.” He uses metaphor to give the listener an idea of how he feels. He is the fountain, which provides water and life. He is the arrowhead, whose purpose is for death. Ecco is admitting that even though there is death, it is also the thing that brings life. It is a cycle. Destruction is a form of creation. At the end of the verse, a voice whispers “Loss and gain.” This sample appears in Bladee and Ecco’s work often and is a reminder that even though we lose things, they always leave space for something new. As the transition comes into the song's second part, the beat completely shifts. The whole first part had low, immersive, and moody sounds. The beat immediately switches to a much bubblier sound with high digital pops. As the beat evolves the song moves from its first part to the second, spearheaded by Bladee.
	Bladee’s vocals jump out at the listener from the start. “Gloria in excelsis, Deo, Deo.” He is referencing the biblical Hymn of the Angels, which directly translates to “Glory to God in the highest.” Bladee goes on to sing “Excelsior, we excel everything and anything.” He is opposing the hymn which holds god above all else in the highest glory. Instead, Bladee is saying that “we,” meaning everyone, can and should be glorified in “everything and anything.” He doesn’t believe that anyone is greater than anyone else. In the next two lines, Bladee maintains his upbeat attitude. “I was gone for a long time but I'm back again. Go 'round again, again for the perfect win.” By going around again and again he is saying that he will never give up. If something isn’t working right, he will workshop it and try again, until he gets the “perfect win.” He knows reaching for perfection will only divert your path into sorrow. 
During the bridge, Bladee shows his vulnerability. “Calm your thoughts, go with the flow, baby, believe in me. Be nothing, but be with me, let’s be heavenly.” Bladee is seeking companionship. He wants to share his idea of “heaven” with someone. When he says “Be nothing, but be with me,” he is telling his companion that he doesn’t care about who they are, or what materialistic things they own. He doesn’t want them for their status or fame, he wants them to be nothing. He wants them both to be nothing together. That is Bladee’s heaven. The bridge stands out because it is singular. Since the song has multiple parts and numerous layers of repetition, a single line or two carries more weight than the rest. Heaven is what Bladee circles back to in all his parts on the song. The bridge gives the listener a point of view of where Bladee is basing his idea of heaven, through his relationships.    
	At the end of the second part, the beat accelerates. Soft tingy pops become higher sounding like a heart monitor preaching flatline. The production creates a sense of anxiety and urgency through the hastening sounds. The beat then switches before any climax can be reached, giving the listener a feeling of whiplash. The chorus of the third part, sung by Ecco, compliments the imagery that Bladee created in the previous part. “Ooh-ooh, could it be? That heaven is fleeting and always, And nothing is forever, and wishing will get you nowhere.” To Ecco, heaven is always there, but it doesn’t last. He once again phrases a question for the listener. He makes sure they know that what he says is his feelings, not the objective truth. Ecco and Bladee share similar philosophies about the idea of “nothing.” When Ecco sings, “And nothing is forever,” he isn’t being nihilistic. What he’s trying to convey is the importance of contentedness. Material things age, break, and last short unimpressive lifespans. If someone can be happy with their nothing they will be happy forever. 
	The penultimate part of the song takes a much lower melodic tune compared to previous ones. Its introduction also includes sounds of farm animals, slowed and reverbed. The farm animals evoke an image of biblical significance, such as the birth of Christ. The production is not there only for symbolism. The unorthodox sounds that the song uses draws the listeners' attention back to the beat. The ebb and flow of the vocals leaves long pauses in the song to let the lyrics sink in while creating an atmosphere of heaven. 
	Bladee opens in a crisper voice than before with the line “Beauty is my drug, I’m the pusher, push it.” A pusher, or dealer, is someone who sells drugs. Bladee is telling the listener how he tries to “push” beauty into the world. His tone is much more shifted than what most rappers sing about in the modern day. Instead of bragging about his wealth or designer clothes, he is bragging that he can provide happiness and beauty to those who listen to his music. He continues, “We think we exist, that’s why we suffer, do we not?” Both artists repeatedly use questioning phrasing when their statements are about large philosophical ideas. When they sing about themselves it’s a fact, for the listener to reap a feeling from. Here, Bladee is leaving it open for interpretation. He believes his suffering is tied to his existence because of a lack of evidence for the contrary. The intro ends with the lines “Sweet but treacherous is the poison, baby. Give it to me raw, death is beautiful (Life).” In the first line, Bladee is commenting on our appeal to the things and people that hurt us. The metaphorical poison is rewarding at first and makes you feel comfortable, but will hurt you in the end. The use of the word “baby,” besides being a popular filler word in modern music, tells the listener that this line is directed at someone. Perhaps a former partner of Bladee. He is actively working through his own trauma on the tape. The second line is repeated numerous times throughout the rest of the fourth part. Bladee doesn’t want death sugarcoated for him. He believes it is something to celebrate. The repetition of the line shows that this is a value that he holds deeply. 
Bladee closes his part by repeating the opening lines, this time, subtly changing it to, “Beauty is my drug, I'm the pusher.” Bladee is telling the close listener that there is nuance to his lyrics. His comparison of beauty to a drug is a social commentary on the addictive quality of fast fashion and the beauty standards that society rests on. Bladee is a “pusher” because he isn’t perfect and often finds himself falling into the same designer traps that others do. On one of his most recent singles, “Victorius,” he sings “I was dirty in designer before it was trendy.” He has prominently worn clothes and accessories from large fashion brands like Moncler and Prada. He feels “dirty” because he thinks that materialism is counteractive to his search for heaven. 
The transition into the final part of the song begins with a sample of TV static. It morphs into something sounding like waves crashing on a beach. The production creates a sense of chaotic peace. Ecco kicks off the finale of the song with a quiet voice. “Uh, arrowhead is you. Uh, arrowhead’s the truth, ha (To me). No, (To me, who else? To me).” He circles back to the start of the song with a call and response between himself. This time metacognitive. He is asking himself who else shares his feelings. He responds that it is just him. The song concludes with Ecco repeating the words “I love you.”
I love you (To eat, to kiss, to love)
I love you (To eat, to love, to kiss)
I love you (To eat, to kiss, to love)
I love you (To love, to last, to kiss)
I love you (To kiss, to last, to love)
I love you (To kiss, to last, to love)
I love you (Never open up)
I love you (Peace with the world)
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
(No one’s watching)
I love you (No one watching, no)
I love you (No one's watching, yeah)
I love you

Ecco spends over a minute on this repetition. He is paying his respect to his and Bladee’s friend Vattenrum, to whom the song is credited. The backup vocals show time passing, “to eat, to kiss, to love.” Their lives are all moving and evolving but the impact Vattenrum had on their lives will remain. The proof is in the lines, in the repetition. 
	Despite its almost nine-minute run time, this song immerses its listener fully. The artists work together with the listener to come to an understanding of their own lives. Ideas of loss, gain, life, death, and heaven are explored in a way that sets no right or wrong answer. The feeling is more important than understanding it perfectly. The song gives its listeners a chance for a new perspective on love. What it means to love someone and grieve their death is all put into question. Some people may not get the song. They might say it’s too long, repetitive, or boring. Perhaps they are just not at the right point in their lives to experience it.
